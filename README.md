## Problem

React Web Code Challenge - Trivia App

The challenge was to create a 10 question, true or false, trivia app with React Web.

The application code will be reviewed and scored on these key areas with many subset areas for each:

* Functionality
* Code Format 
* Project Structure
* Scalability
* Maintainability
* Use of industry best practices

API: https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&difficulty=hard&type=boolean

## Solution
The solution was very simple I use React js with Nextjs for the client. I also use styled component that way the app only render the styles that only need it. I consider use Typescript too for the entire app that way have better control with the dinamic typed that use javascript

* Client
  * Reactjs 🐱‍👓
  * Nextjs 🐱‍🏍
  * Context Api 🐱‍👤
  * Typescript 🛠 
  * Styled component 💅

## For testing
I use Jest with React Testing Library that goes really well with Nextjs, to run it just type: 

```bash

npm run test

```
